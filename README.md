# Minimal Python Docker
A simple and minimal devcontainer for Python development in **Visual Studio Code** with Docker. To quickly get started do the following:

1. Clone repository
1. Use VSC's `Remote-Containers` Extension
1. Run `Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...`

Disclaimer: The provided `Dockerfile` is very basic and arguably bad. Ideally check out https://docs.docker.com/ for best practices.
